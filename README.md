# Temperatures
Output of a Swift UI Tutorial exercise for Day 19 of 100 Days of Swift. This simple application 
leverages Swift UI.

## Power of Swift switch/case
The more I learn about Swift the more I like it. For this exercise I wanted to be able to convert to and
from different temperature scales. A nice typesafe way to this involves using enums and tuples which Swift
switch/case syntax supports. I don't think I have found the most abstract and typesafe solution but for 
simple and clear code the ability to use tuples and enums is pretty nice.
